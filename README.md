# Petz Headers

## Build instructions

Add as an additional include directory to your Visual Studio project.

Add the lib to the linker.

## Caveats

Variables are not specced out, they're just roughly the right sizes (determined by placement of vb/vftables).

Only virtual functions are completely represented in the existing classes.
