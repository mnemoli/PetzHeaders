# Petz Headers

## Build instructions

Add as an additional include directory to your Visual Studio project.

Add the lib to the linker.

## Caveats

Variables are not specced out, they're just roughly the right sizes (determined by placement of vb/vftables).

Only virtual functions are completely represented in the existing classes.

## Usage restrictions

There are no official usage restrictions. However, I strongly encourage anyone using this project, or basing their hexed content on this project, to support the [four essential freedoms of free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en#four-freedoms) by:

- Allowing others to run your content in any way they wish, without restriction
- Sharing your source code when possible
- Allowing others to inspect and study your content without needing permission
- Allowing others to redistribute your content without needing permission
- Allowing others to modify your content and distribute the modified version without needing permission

Help the Petz community learn and grow by sharing content and knowledge freely!
